Unofficial implementation of the paper [P-Flow: A Fast and Data-Efficient Zero-Shot TTS through Speech Prompting](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=zNA7u7wtIN) by NVIDIA.

While recent large-scale neural codec language models have shown significant improvement in zero-shot TTS by training on thousands of hours of data, they suffer from drawbacks such as a lack of robustness, slow sampling speed similar to previous autoregressive TTS methods, and reliance on pre-trained neural codec representations. Our work proposes P-Flow, a fast and data-efficient zero-shot TTS model that uses speech prompts for speaker adaptation. P-Flow comprises a speechprompted text encoder for speaker adaptation and a flow matching generative decoder for high-quality and fast speech synthesis. Our speech-prompted text encoder uses speech prompts and text input to generate speaker-conditional text representation. The flow matching generative decoder uses the speaker-conditional output to synthesize high-quality personalized speech significantly faster than in real-time. Unlike the neural codec language models, we specifically train P-Flow on LibriTTS dataset using a continuous mel-representation. Through our training method using continuous speech prompts, P-Flow matches the speaker similarity performance of the large-scale zero-shot TTS models with two orders of magnitude less training data and has more than 20Ã— faster sampling speed. Our results show that P-Flow has better pronunciation and is preferred in human likeness and speaker similarity to its recent state-of-the-art counterparts, thus defining P-Flow as an attractive and desirable alternative.

# Quick run in Google Colab

# Instructions to run
0. Create an environment (suggested but optional)
``` sh
conda create -n pflowtts python=3.10 -y
conda activate pflowtts
```

Stay in the root directory (of course clone the repo first!)
``` sh
cd pflowtts_pytorch
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Build Monotonic Alignment Search 
```sh
# Cython-version Monotonoic Alignment Search
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
```

Let's assume we are training with LJ Speech

2. Download the dataset from [here](https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/), extract it to `data/LJSpeech-1.1`, and prepare the file lists to point to the extracted data like for [item 5 in the setup of the NVIDIA Tacotron 2 repo](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2#setup).

3. Go to `configs/data/ljspeech.yaml` and change
```yaml
train_filelist_path: data/filelists/ljs_audio_text_train_filelist.txt
valid_filelist_path: data/filelists/ljs_audio_text_val_filelist.txt
```
<!-- 4. Generate normalisation statistics with the yaml file of dataset configuration

```bash
cd pflowtts_pytorch/pflow/utils
python generate_data_statistics.py -i ljspeech.yaml
# Output:
#{'mel_mean': -5.53662231756592, 'mel_std': 2.1161014277038574}
```

Update these values in `configs/data/ljspeech.yaml` under `data_statistics` key.

```bash
data_statistics:  # Computed for ljspeech dataset
  mel_mean: -5.536622
  mel_std: 2.116101
```
to the paths of your train and validation filelists. -->

5. Run the training script

```bash
make train-ljspeech
```

or

```bash
python pflow/train.py experiment=ljspeech
```

- for multi-gpu training, run

```bash
python pflow/train.py experiment=ljspeech trainer.devices=[0,1]
```

## Architecture details
- [x] Speech prompted text encoder with Prenet and RoPE Transformer
- [x] Duration predictor with MAS
- [x] Flow matching generative decoder with CFM (paper uses wavenet decoder; we use modified wavenet and optional U-NET decoder is included to experiment with)
- [x] Speech prompt input currently slices the input spectrogram and concatenates it with the text embedding. Can support external speech prompt input (during training as well)
- [x] pflow prompt masking loss for training
- [x] HiFiGan for vocoder

## TODOs, features and update notes
- [x] For end2end training, we combine HiFiGan with the CFM based latent generation and add a 'lil bit of stochasticity here and there.
- [x] not using discriminator for training yet, but it is there in commented code.
- [x] Anyone is welcome to contribute to this repo. Please feel free to open an issue or a PR.
